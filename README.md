###Start Here
[WATCH THIS INTRODUCTION VIDEO BEFORE COMPLETING ANY OF THE TRAININGS](https://youtu.be/mG0H6OWUD3I)

In this training series, you will be going through these training videos, and then working through the concepts covered within them by doing the practice problems that follow each video. Each training has multiple practice problems so that you can complete the training multiple times without repeating the same practice unless it is needed.

After completing the practice problems, you should set a goal for the following week with your facillitator. 

Finally, each practice also includes 'Black Diamond' exercises and goals for people who wish to push their progression in teaching a little further. These are not required, but can be used as additional resources. 

If you need any help, clarification, or have suggestions for edits, training topics, or other improvements, please feel free to email me at cory@devmounta.in or you can slack Cory Johnson (@corymj). 

Let's get started. 

## <a name="week1"></a> Accountability in Education
### [Video Training](http://youtube.com)
### Practice Problems
1. Pair off with a partner or facillitator. *Take turns* discussing experiences you've had recently where you felt as if there was nothing you could do to help a student; a student was doing poorly and it was all his or her fault; or something else happened and you wondered whether or not there was more that you could have done. Discuss the details of the interaction, but try to remain objective and honest - and encourage your partner to as well by asking additional questions. Give each other feedback. 
  1. In light of the recent training, what could you have done more? 
  2. What of that situation was purely on the student? 
  3. What early intervention (actions taken long before a problem arises) could've either prevented this, or at least made it easier to deal with?

Having clear talks like this can help you develop an attitude of responsibility toward the things you can change, and help you to recognize that you can still be successful as a teacher even when some things are outside your control

### Goals
1. Based on the discussion above, set two goals for the coming week:
  1. What specifically could you be doing more to help students understand the content of the course?
  2. Where do you consistently waste time or energy that may not impact the student's learning as much as other things could? What specific actions can you take to spend less mental energy on these tasks? 

### Black Diamond
1. Look back on how this last week's lectures and projects have gone. Understanding that it is your job to help students wrap their heads around difficult technical concepts, build original coding projects, and remain positive in the face of a 12+ week marathon of failures and feeling like an imposter - what more could you do this next week? Set an additional goal to **one** of the following in the coming week:
  1. Bring in an object lesson or video example to help students learn a difficult concept.
  2. Give students examples to work through or projects that are slightly silly in nature to help break up the monotony of being a student. Turn examples or projects into jokes (everyone agrees that even bad jokes are better than no jokes at all).
  3. Communicate with all of your students as if you were their personal cheerleader. It may sound hoaky or cheesy, but say stuff that makes people feel like you are rooting for them all of the time. If you're not good at words that come out of your mouth or social niceties, try to end every interaction with a smile and "I'm rooting for you." 
  4. If you think you can do better in some other way, then set a goal to do that. 


## <a name="week2"></a> Teaching With Clarity
- [Video Training](http://youtube.com)
### Practice Problems
1. Take a look at the next topic you will be lecturing on. Take 10 minutes to prepare a lesson plan for one of the learning objectives in that lecture - taking extra care to separate it into activities to help students understand the concept, and to apply it together and on their own. Then pair off, take 5 minutes each to teach your learning objective to your partner, and then discuss how successful you were at helping the students understand and apply the material.
  1. For the understand section, think of some metaphors, object lessons, or other ways you can help the student connect what they know to what you are trying to teach them. 
  2. For the remember section, try to give the students an activity to work through with you that is as close to your final expectation as possible, and let the students drive that activity. Only tell them what to do if none of them can remember - otherwise the entire activity should be you asking them what they need to do to complete the next step in the process.
 2. As a group, identify which concept your current students struggle the most to grasp. Break into pairs and come up with as many different ways to explain this concept as you can in 8 minutes. Then come back together and discuss your ideas with the rest of the group. Some good tactics for coming up with new ways to explain things include:
   1. Metaphors/Similes
   2. Object lessons
   3. Connecting to prior knowledge or past topics

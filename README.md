###Start Here
[WATCH THIS INTRODUCTION VIDEO BEFORE COMPLETING ANY OF THE TRAININGS](https://youtu.be/5FG3KVSypX4)

In this training series, you will be going through these training videos, and then working through the concepts covered within them by doing the practice problems that follow each video. Each training has multiple practice problems so that you can complete the training multiple times without repeating the same practice unless it is needed.

After completing the practice problems, you should set a goal for the following week with your facillitator. 

Finally, each practice also includes 'Black Diamond' exercises and goals for people who wish to push their progression in teaching a little further. These are not required, but can be used as additional resources. 

If you need any help, clarification, or have suggestions for edits, training topics, or other improvements, please feel free to email me at cory@devmounta.in or you can slack Cory Johnson (@corymj). 

Let's get started. 

## <a name="week1"></a> Accountability in Education
### [Video Training](https://youtu.be/irQ3Zyh5e8A)
### Practice Problems
Having clear talks like the following practices can help you develop an attitude of responsibility toward the things you can change, and help you to recognize that you can still be successful as a teacher even when some things are outside your control. It is important that, during these conversations, we try to be as honest with ourselves and with others as possible - striking the balance between being overly critical, and blinding yourself with a false sense of accomplishment by constantly assuming that you or your partner are already doing great. 

1. Pair off with a partner or facillitator. *Take turns* discussing experiences you've had recently where you felt as if there was nothing you could do to help a student; a student was doing poorly and it was all his or her fault; or something else happened and you wondered whether or not there was more that you could have done. Discuss the details of the interaction, but try to remain objective and honest - and encourage your partner to as well by asking additional questions. Give each other feedback. 
  1. In light of the recent training, what could you have done more? 
  2. What of that situation was purely on the student? 
  3. What early intervention (actions taken long before a problem arises) could've either prevented this, or at least made it easier to deal with?
2. Pair off with a partner or facillitator. Take two minutes to think of the last time a student asked you a difficult or frustrating problem. *Take turns* sharing the experience with your partner and talking about your response. In light of the discussion about taking accountability for the emotional state of your students, answer the following questions together:
  1. With your response, were you trying to solve the student's problem (worker mindset) or solve the problem that the student doesn't understand (teacher mindset)?
  2. Were you able to leave the student feeling more accomplished, or did you just solve the problem for them?
  3. Did your tone, word choice, etc. communicate encouragement to the student?

### Goals
1. Based on the discussion above, set two goals for the coming week. Write the goals down, and plan on using them all week:
  1. What specifically could you be doing more to help students understand the content of the course?
  2. Where do you consistently waste time or energy that may not impact the student's learning as much as other things could? What specific actions can you take to spend less mental energy on these tasks? 

### Black Diamond
1. Look back on how this last week's lectures and projects have gone. Understanding that it is your job to help students wrap their heads around difficult technical concepts, build original coding projects, and remain positive in the face of a 12+ week marathon of failures and feeling like an imposter - what more could you do this next week? Set an additional goal to **one** of the following in the coming week:
  1. Bring in an object lesson or video example to help students learn a difficult concept.
  2. Give students examples to work through or projects that are slightly silly in nature to help break up the monotony of being a student. Turn examples or projects into jokes (everyone agrees that even bad jokes are better than no jokes at all).
  3. Communicate with all of your students as if you were their personal cheerleader. It may sound hoaky or cheesy, but say stuff that makes people feel like you are rooting for them all of the time. If you're not good at words that come out of your mouth or social niceties, try to end every interaction with a smile and "I'm rooting for you." 
  4. If you think you can do better in some other way, then set a goal to do that. 


## <a name="week2"></a> Teaching With Clarity
### [Video Training](https://youtu.be/2cHK6D1_nz8)
### Practice Problems
1. Take a look at the next topic you will be lecturing on. Take 10 minutes to prepare a lesson plan for one of the learning objectives in that lecture - taking extra care to separate it into activities to help students understand the concept, and to apply it together and on their own. Then pair off, take 5 minutes each to teach your learning objective to your partner, and then discuss how successful you were at helping the students understand and apply the material.
  1. For the understand section, think of some metaphors, object lessons, or other ways you can help the student connect what they know to what you are trying to teach them. 
  2. For the remember section, try to give the students an activity to work through with you that is as close to your final expectation as possible, and let the students drive that activity. Only tell them what to do if none of them can remember - otherwise the entire activity should be you asking them what they need to do to complete the next step in the process.
 2. As a group, identify which concept your current students struggle the most to grasp. Break into pairs and come up with as many different ways to explain this concept as you can in 8 minutes. Then come back together and discuss your ideas with the rest of the group. Some good tactics for coming up with new ways to explain things include:
    1. Metaphors/Similes
    2. Object lessons
    3. Connecting to prior knowledge or past topics

### Goals
1. Based on the video training, choose **one** of the goals below to focus on for the next week. Make your decision based on what you think would be most important for you to focus on. Write the goal down, and plan on using it all week:
  1. Every time you deliver a lecture, make sure that you start by teaching students to understand difficult concepts and that every lecture includes the necessary examples or metaphors to help students understand. 
  2. Every time you teach a new concept, plan time to check that your students understand before making them do projects. Plan guided practice into your lesson plans where you force the students to teach you the concepts you have covered, or apply them while you watch so that you can correct misunderstandings or help them when they don't remember. 
  3. Make a goal to force every student to participate in the course of a week as many times as possible by planning in enough questions so that you can make sure every student has a chance to answer, and call on students by name rather than letting anyone answer. 
  4. Make a goal to answer every single question posed to you in the pattern of understand and then apply. First help students understand the thing they are asking about, and then walk them through a scenario where they would use it or give them a scenario to solve before considering the question answered. 

### Black Diamond
1. Take time this week to look at all of your lesson plans for lectures. Highlight each section of the lesson plan in one of 2 colors - so that you know whether the goal of that section is to help students *understand* or *apply*. While delivering lectures or answering questions, remain aware of which "mode" you should be in and which mode will be most helpful to the students.
  1. When you are in "understand mode," you should be doing lots of talking, giving as many examples, definitions, or explanations as you can to help students wrap their head around the topic.
  2. When you are in "apply mode," it's time to shut up. Ask a lot of questions, force the students to remember it themselves or complete a small project, and congratulate them when they succeed at doing so. 


## <a name="week3"></a> Assessing the Learning Context
### [Video Training](https://youtu.be/FakSyit62dA)
### Practice Problems
1. It's time to play as though you are a student with a question. Pair off into partners or small groups. Start by taking 5 minutes to create an "I don't understand problem," like seen in the video training. Identify a concept or example from your course with some complexity. Identify one portion of that question as the section that you "don't get." Then, *take turns* with your partner answerring each other questions. The person acting as a student should present the example they are struggling with, and the person acting as instructor has to find out what portion the student doesn't understand, and then teach that concept. 
2. Take 15 minutes to write a new lesson plan for the next lecture you need to give. Start by identifying the learning objective. Then write down the information that you expect students to have mastered before beginning that lecture (which can often be found by looking at learning objectives from previous days). Finally, list all of the concepts that you will need to teach them in order to bridge the gap between where they are and where you want them to be. Take time to try and imagine where they will be coming from, what you would teach, and how you would teach it. Then evaluate, based on what you have written, whether or not your students would be able to understand the topics you intend to cover with just the knowledge they have so far. Then, share your plan with a partner and *take turns* giving each other feedback. 
3. Write down the names of all of your current students. Then, write down the following for each:
  1. Where they are in their personal progress through the curriculum
  2. How they are doing emotionally, and at completing assignments
  3. What they still don't understand or struggle with. 
  4. After identifying these things, set goal iv below. 

### Goals
1. Based on the discussions you've just had and the video training, set goals to do **one** of the following in the coming week. Choose which goal to set based on what you think is most important for you, write the goal down, and plan on using it all week:
  1. Resolve to answer every curriculum-related question in the coming week with a question. Do not answer any questions without first seeking to understand more of what the student needs. Even if the question *seems* crystal clear to you, ask a clarifying question before answering it. 
  2. Resolve to take time "Reading the Room" before you begin each lecture. Rather than talking about the weather, or launching straight into your lesson plan, ask students how they are doing, what they have recently completed, and whether or not they understood it. Do this every single time, and vary which students you talk to. 
  3. Write all of your lesson plans or lecture plans this week in the format used in this video. Every lesson plan should *at least* include (be as specific as possible):
    1. What your learning objective for the lesson is.
    2. What the student should know going into the lesson.
    3. What concepts need to go into the lesson to help the student be prepared to understand all of the learning objectives? 
  4. Looking at your list of students, set specific plans and goals for them. What can be done to help improve their understanding, starting at the level they are at? If they are up to current standards, what resources or challenges could push them further?

### Black Diamond
1. Have another mentor or instructor watch you teach a lesson or answer questions, and then discuss together whether or not you were successful in reading the room, understanding student needs, and teaching specifically to those needs.

## <a name="week6"></a> Personal Analysis
### [Video Training](https://youtu.be/qc6Cr4NPN_w)

### Practice Problems
1. Look back at your last week of teaching. Take a couple minutes to write down each of the topics you delivered lectures on or taught to students. Then complete **two** of the following analyses and discuss them with a partner or facillitator (3 minutes per problem, per person):
  1. For each day, write down whether or not you provided adequate time and introduction to new topics. Did you help students understand the processes they needed to know to complete the projects, or did you unintentionally push them to start using them and only focus on teaching them how to use them?
  2. For each day, write down what questions students had, and what they were getting caught on? Did multiple people run into  the same problem? What could be done to change how you taught that material to allow you to use the 3-step 'task analysis' method of teaching - wherein you start at the level of the students and work incrementally toward the learning objective? 
  3. For each day, what activities made students discouraged? How did you respond to that discouragement? What of your actions could add even more discouragement to students? What could you do to help them feel positive and motivated?
  4. What metrics could you collect on your performance (for each of the topics you teach) that would be interesting to you? Would you like to know which students get it and which don't when you're done talking and they have to begin their project? Would you like to know students' general level of discouragement? Would you like to know which examples that you used helped the most students? Discuss with your partner or facillitator which metrics are important to you as a teacher, and how you can begin to get a better objective understanding (through metrics) of those outcomes.
2. Pull out a piece of paper or a note-taking app. Write down one thing you would like to improve at. What is something you would like to see improvement on in your personal performance as an instructor? This is not a goal - it is called an outcome - but it is important to record before doing the rest of this practice activity. After you have recorded your outcome, ask yourself why you want to improve at that thing and write that down. What is your thinking behind that goal? Then ask yourself why that thinking matters to you and write that down. What is your motivation or thinking behind that thinking? Now that we've found your motivation, share what you've written down with a partner or facillitator and take turns coming up with specific actions (goals) that you can take to improve that outcome, and remember that your motivation is the reason those specific actions matter. This should be reflected in your goals in the next section. 

### Goals
1. Based on the discussions you've just had and the video training, set goals to do **one** of the following in the coming week. Choose which goal to set based on what you think is most important for you, write the goal down, and plan on using it all week:
  1. Resolve to ask follow-up questions with students such as "Who gets it?" or "Where did you get lost?" to gain a better understanding of your own performance as a teacher. Set goals to ask these questions at certain times in your coming sessions, or a certain number of times per day. Track yourself to make sure you actually do it. 
  2. Depending on which practice problem you completed, make specific goals to work on any holes that you identified in your teaching. 

### Black Diamond
1. Set a camera up or ask someone else to set a camera up to record one of your teaching sesssions. Before watching the video, identify some aspect of your performance that you want to evaluate (How encouraging was my word choice and tone when answering questions) and watch the video, taking notes as you do. It's important to note that EVERYONE hates watching videos of themselves - so try to ignore everything you hate about the experience and just pay attention to the one thing that you are evaluating. Once you are done watching the video, make goals to improve on that area in the coming week. If you are looking for *super* fast improvement, repeat this process multiple times.

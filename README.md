###Start Here
[Watch this introduction video before completing any of the trainings](https://youtu.be/mG0H6OWUD3I)

In this training series, you will be going through these training videos, and then working through the concepts covered within them by doing the practice problems that follow each video. Each training has multiple practice problems so that you can complete the training multiple times without repeating the same practice unless it is needed.

After completing the practice problems, you should set a goal for the following week with your facillitator. 

Finally, each practice also includes 'Black Diamond' exercises and goals for people who wish to push their progression in teaching a little further. These are not required, but can be used as additional resources. 

Let's get started.
